# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to the handling of `null` and `undefined` values.  The `bug.js` file contains a function that correctly addresses `null` inputs, while the `bugSolution.js` file shows how this can be improved. The improved version is more robust and clearly handles edge cases. This is particularly helpful when dealing with external data sources, which might return null values.  Understanding how to properly handle `null` and `undefined` is crucial for building reliable and robust JavaScript applications.
